## Overview

This game server is an open source multi user dimension (MUD).  Useful features from other open source
code bases like Smaug will be included.  The goal will be to provide a useful game that keeps the feel
of the version that pre-date it.

If you would like to contribute areas, code, etc. feel free to contact me and/or issue a pull request when you're
contribution is complete.  If you have found a bug, file an issue here with details or steps to recreate so I can 
fix it.  I invite and welcome any contributions.  Great muds are a combination of the code and the content.  You
can't have just one or the other.

## OS Support:

  - Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS
  - Rasbian for use with the RaspberryPi
  - Windows 10 - [Compiles with Visual Studio 2017 Community](./doc/setup-windows.md).

## Resources

Unfortunately over the years the best resources have been lost to time.  I will try to
provide new documentation and archive old documentation as I can find it.  The best 
old resource was the rom mailing list but alas it does not exist at it's old locations
which were at:

  - [https://www.mail-archive.com/search?l=rom@rom.org](https://www.mail-archive.com/search?l=rom@rom.org)

Here are some related resources that are thanksfully still active.
