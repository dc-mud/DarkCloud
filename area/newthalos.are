old mage reclines against the mirror behind the bar absentmindedly pouring
several drinks at once with his refined telekinesis. The Lokettes, a local
band, are playing their usual gig on the stage. The large booths along the
wall are filled with people drinking and having a grand time. You feel like
partying here.

As you walk by the mercenary guild a cold chill causes you to shiver
uncontrollably. You see some shady looking characters lurking about the
entrance to this house of 'helpful' people. Perhaps curiosity gets the
best of you, but you wonder what could be going on inside. To the north
you see the open doors of the apothecary shop where one may buy many
magical livations.

Two large stone towers imbedded in the wall loom over you. The massive
iron gate, emblazened with the crest of New Thalos, swings easily on
four ornately crafted hinges. It is obvious the makers of this city spared no
expense in protecting their home.  Main street heads towards the market
westward and the wilderness beckons from the east. To the north lies the

Nowhere have you seen such an obscene display of wealth than in this
corridor. The shag carpeting under your feet makes it seem as if you are
walking on a cloud. Platinum candelabras hang delicately from the ceiling
casting light on the ancient tapestries adorning the walls. The crick
in your neck tells you it's time to stop staring. To the west the
numerous halls of the palace begin and the gate lies to the east.

The river calms a bit after being thrashed in the interior of
the mountain. Although still deep within the rocks you can see
faint traces of green to the east.

Ishtar River~
The river flows out from the city down a long winding gully towards
the Sea of Dragons. To the south of you lies the great eastern desert
and north a wide open expanse of grass. You can just barely make out
a road that seems to be traveling alongside the river but the banks are
too steep for you to see very far.

A Split in the River~
The waters of the river crash down upon a rock and split into
two bodies of water. The river you are on continues its southern
course and the new river heads off to the east. To the west you notice
a flat area in the sheer rock where it would be possible to shore your
craft. The River of lost souls also continues to the north.

This is where the river empties out into the Dragon Sea. The backrush
of water has kicked up a lot of sand and the blue sea is stained where
the river empties. Looking east, all you can see is water....all the way
to the horizon. North of here is a small dock you think you should be
able to reach with out too much trouble. The river stretches off to
the west back towards New Thalos.

On a road~
The people of New Thalos take great pride in the services their
city may provide. One of these services is the construction crews
that go to great lengths to keep all the roads in order. Although
the taxes in New Thalos are higher than other cities in the realm
most of the money is used for the good of the people.
